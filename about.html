             <p>As a result of my hard work i recieved an extension to continue working until i finished school and graduated in June, 2025</p>
             <p>My interest in coding and Development came about as a result of the exposure the school has given me whereby i have had the opportunty to learn about the value of having IT skills such as coding. This aroused my curiosity and thus i beganmy coding journey, whereby Power Learning Project was able to make that dream a success.</p>
             <p>I am slowly growing my skills and porfolio using gaining an aptitude to create using languages such as Python and CSS</p>
